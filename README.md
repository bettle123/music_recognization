# Music Symbols Recognition with CNN

@Author: Su, Ming Yi <br />

@Library: OpenCV, Tensorflow, OpenGL <br />

I applied cutting-edge Machine Learning technique: Convolutional Neural Networks to classify music symbols. </br>
Designed CNN architecture and trained CNN model by tensorflow. </br>
Simulated the training data including illumination, rotation, scale, translation by OpenGL Phong shading. </br>
Increased diversity of training data and implemented image segmentation with music knowledge by OpenCV. </br>

This project is my master project, there are 6 directories. <br/>
	- music_recognization <br />
	- music_simulation_3D <br />
	- music_simulation_preprocess <br />
	- music_simulation_software <br />
	- music_training <br />
	- Ouput <br />





Here is the pipeline for my project. <br/>

@Library: OpenCV, Tensorflow <br />

I applied cutting-edge Machine Learning technique: Convolutional Neural Networks to classify music symbols. </br>
Designed CNN architecture and trained CNN model by tensorflow. </br>
Simulated the training data including illumination, rotation, scale, translation by OpenGL Phong shading. </br>
Increased diversity of training data and implemented image segmentation with music knowledge by OpenCV. </br>


Due to the fact that this project is in progress, I have not pushed the programs how I train the model and how I simulate training data by OpenGL and so on. <br/>




Here is the pipeline for my project. <br/>
